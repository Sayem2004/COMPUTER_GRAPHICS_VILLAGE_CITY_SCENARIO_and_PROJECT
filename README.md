## Village and City Animation – C++ OpenGL Project  

The Village and City Animation project is an interactive computer graphics simulation developed using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT). It showcases two distinct environments: a peaceful village with natural scenery and a bustling city with urban elements. The project features dynamic transitions between these two scenes, controlled through user input.  

In the village scene, the animation includes a bright sky, moving clouds, a shining sun, mountains, trees, houses, a wind turbine, and a flowing river. A boat moves across the river, with its speed controlled by mouse interactions—left-click increases speed, while right-click decreases it. The city scene, on the other hand, presents tall buildings, roads, moving cars, a railway system with a train, and an active urban atmosphere. The transition between the two scenes happens with a simple key press: pressing 'B' switches from the village to the city, while pressing 'A' returns to the village.  

This project demonstrates the power of OpenGL transformations, using translation, scaling, and rotation to create smooth animations. It also incorporates basic interactivity, allowing users to control elements in real-time. The combination of mathematical calculations and graphical rendering makes it an excellent learning tool for computer graphics, scene design, and OpenGL animation techniques.  

Future enhancements could include features like night mode, dynamic weather, sound effects, and user-controlled camera movements to make the experience even more immersive. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in computer graphics, game development, or simulation design using OpenGL.
